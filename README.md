# OCR
This project is an OCR-based text extraction system built using Python and EasyOCR to extract the complete text line containing the pattern “1” from shipping label images. A preprocessing pipeline is used to improve accuracy by converting images to grayscale, removing noise, applying thresholding, and correcting rotation before running OCR. EasyOCR then reads the text, and a regex-based method identifies the exact line containing the “1” pattern. The system uses confidence scores to select the most accurate match. A Streamlit interface allows users to upload images, run OCR, and view extracted results clearly. The project follows a modular structure, including separate components for preprocessing, OCR logic, and text extraction. A test script processes the dataset, compares outputs with expected values, and calculates total accuracy. The system meets the required 75% extraction accuracy and handles challenges such as noise, blur, and different label layouts. Future improvements may include integrating advanced OCR models and GPU acceleration.
